You're correct docker-compose is to bring up multi-container applications. Earlier you used to do docker run .. to start every container. Usually modern applications embracing the micro-services paradigm can be made up of dozens of services and using docker run .. will get very tiresome very soon. Hence docker-compose allows you to express all the containers and their properties and how they connect to each other as a yaml or json file so you can manage it in an easier fashion.

So, docker-compose is the container orchestration part in the docker ecosystem.

Links are different, they are just a part of docker-compose or docker run commands and are deprecated in favor of software defined networks of which overlay networks are just one of them.

Swarm is the scheduling component in docker. What is scheduling - it is nothing but figuring out where to "place" your containers in your cluster of docker hosts. You can have a cluster of hundreds of servers, and you may have hundreds of containers, each encapsulating a service for a dozen different applications. Now how should these containers be distributed across your cluster of hundreds of servers, should some containers be placed only on certain hosts because they satisfy a particular criteria or maybe they should be closer to (or not) other containers which are somehow related... all these are part of the scheduling component which is performed by docker Swarm.
